- **h1 Element:** An h1 element with the topic of the page is included at the top.
- **Introduction Paragraph:** A paragraph introducing the topic is placed below the h1 element.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply copy the provided HTML code into an HTML file and open it in your preferred web browser.

### Prerequisites
No special tools or software are required. A modern web browser is all you need to view the page.

## üíª Implementation
To fulfill the user stories and ensure all tests were met, the following steps were taken:
1. **HTML Structure:** The HTML document was structured with a main element containing the primary content of the page.
2. **Heading and Introduction:** An h1 element was added to define the main topic, followed by a paragraph to introduce the content.
3. **Sections:** Three section elements were created, each containing an h2 element for the sub-topic, a paragraph for the description, and an iframe element for the embedded video.
4. **Valid Video Sources:** The iframe elements were provided with src attributes linking to relevant videos from the Crash Course YouTube channel.
5. **Iframe Attributes:** Attributes such as title, width, and height were added to each iframe to ensure proper description and sizing.

By following these steps, all user stories were met, and the project passed all specified tests, ensuring a successful solution.

## üé® Styling
The webpage includes futuristic-themed styling to enhance its space exploration theme. The CSS file, `styles.css`, is linked to the HTML and adds the following design elements:
- **Dark Theme:** A dark, space-inspired background (#0d1117) with light gray text for readability.
- **Glowing Effects:** Bright blue glowing effects for headings, borders, and iframes.
- **Typography:** The `Orbitron` font, providing a sleek, futuristic feel.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to smaller screens, ensuring the content looks great on all devices.

### How to Use the Styling
1. Save the CSS code in a file named `styles.css`.
2. Link the CSS file to the HTML by adding the following line inside the `<head>` section:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```
3. Open the HTML file in your browser to see the stylish design in action.
